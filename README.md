UP Dormitory Website Mock-up

This project is a mock-up of a potential website for the UP Cebu Dormitory. It serves as a conceptual design and demonstration of what a website for our dormitory might look like if implemented in the future. Additionally, this project is a personal exercise to practice and enhance my skills in Next.js and React.
